/// Guard against blocking render paths in the detached panel.
///
/// # Background: the Wayland deadlock
///
/// The original implementation used `ctx.show_viewport_immediate()` to open
/// the panel in a real OS window.  On Wayland, eframe's wgpu painter calls
/// `pollster::block_on(painter.set_window(viewport_id, Some(window)))` once
/// per viewport per frame.  When a Wayland compositor suspends frame delivery
/// to a window (because it was minimised or moved behind another window),
/// that future never resolves and the call blocks forever, freezing the whole
/// application.  This code path is still present and unfixed in eframe 0.34.2.
///
/// The fix is to avoid creating a separate OS surface for the panel at all.
/// `Window` renders the detached panel as a floating overlay inside the
/// *same* OS window, so there is only one Wayland surface - the compositor
/// cannot suspend it independently of the main window.
///
/// # What this test checks
///
/// `egui_kittest` is headless. It cannot trigger the real Wayland deadlock.
/// What it *can* do is verify that the detached panel code path completes
/// each frame quickly and does not introduce any O(n²) loops or accidentally
/// blocking operations that would manifest even in a headless runner.
/// If a future change re-introduces a blocking call, this test will time out.
